      <p>With over two decades of hands-on delivery in enterprise governance and solution architecture, AI Regulate draws on deep experience from high-profile technology engagements with RMIT University, financial institutions, and the Victorian Government.

This expertise now powers a dedicated team focused on scalable solutions that enable large organisations to safely adopt AI and realise enterprise-wide benefits.

Our flagship innovation, the ai:R Platform, is a world-first AI Governance Engine—the only system to offer embedded, real-time control and reporting at the point of AI use.

Built on a patent-pending architecture, ai:R introduces a novel enforcement layer that enables customisable governance directly within AI workflows. This approach meets the emerging demands of responsible deployment with precision, transparency, and operational control—a capability not offered by conventional oversight tools or post-hoc auditing systems.</p>
